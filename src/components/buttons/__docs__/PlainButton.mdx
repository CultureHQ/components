prependJs:
- import PlainButton from "../PlainButton";

## `<PlainButton>`

A `button` that has all of its styles reset. Useful for when you want to maintain adherence to semantics and a11y but effectively just want to capture an event interaction.

* `children` - the contents of the button
* `className?` - an extra class name

{{
  <PlainButton onClick={() => alert("Clicked!")}>
    Click me
  </PlainButton>
}}
