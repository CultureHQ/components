## `<SearchBar>`

A search bar that throttles the searches so it does not fire too quickly.

* `autoComplete = "on"` - controls the `autocomplete` HTML attribute on the `input` field
* `autoFocus = false` - whether or not the component should request focus on initial mount
* `className?` - an extra class name
* `onSearch` - a callback prop for when a search has been triggered
* `onSearchChange?` - a callback prop for when the search bar changes text
* `placeholder = ""` - a placeholder for the search bar
* `throttle = 300` - how fast to allow searches to happen (in ms), can be `null` which will result in immediate searches
