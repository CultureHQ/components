## `<Modal>`

A wrapper around `ModalDialog` that maintains the state of whether or not the dialog is currently open. It provides a `trigger` render function that allows the consumer to define how it gets triggered.

This component has the same subcomponents as the `Panel` component, just namespaced under the `Modal` component, e.g., `Modal.Heading`. It has the same props as the `ModalDialog` component, in addition to:

* `onClose` - called when the modal is closed
* `startOpen = false` - indicates that the dialog should be open when rendered
* `trigger` - a function that accepts as one argument an `onTrigger` function and returns a valid React component.
