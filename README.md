# culturehq-components

CultureHQ's component library.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have `node` and `yarn` installed on your system. Then run `yarn` in the root of the repository to install the dependencies. You can then start the local server with `yarn start`. You can now view the various components at `http://localhost:8080`.
